This is our project for the CrimsonCode Hackathon IX. The theme is connection and we decided to create a news app written in C/C++ to connect users based on their interests. Once a match is found, they can chat with each other. There are many other functions such as adding, selecting, displaying, deleting users, etc. You can also save and load from a file.
